# <div align="leftcenter">Analysis of the Iris Dataset</div></b>

***

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of three species of Iris flowers. 50 samples from Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica. The length and width of the sepals and petals of each flower was measured.

The describe() function in pandas generates descriptive statistics of the dataFrame giving a summary of the central tendency, dispersion and shape of the distribution of the dataset. 

Sepal Length: 
-   The mean and median are close indicating a symmetric distribution
-   the standard deviation of 0.83 indicates low variability. 


Sepal Width:
-   the mean 3.06cm and median 3.00cm are close showing symmetric distribution, with an even lower standard deviation of 0.44 showing low variability. 


Petal Length:
-   The mean of 3.76 is significantly lower than the median of 4.35 indicating a left skewed distribution. 
-   A higher standard deviation of 1.76 indicates a higher variability among the data points. 

-   

Petal Width: 
-   The mean of 1.2 is slightly lower than the median of 1.3 which could indicate a slightly left skew. 
-   A standard deviation of 0.76 is low
